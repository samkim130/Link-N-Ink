Social Media Tattoo App

Work in progress for a tattoo social media app that connects artists to app users/potential customers

Technologies:
Spring Boot - backend
Spring Data & temporary PostgreSQL on local docker machine
React - frontend (https://github.com/samkim130/linkink-web)
Amazon S3 - for image uploads


credit to a friend (UX/UI designer student: jaeheegil96@gmail.com) for initial design and ideas

Next Steps...
1. upload to cloud and establish database (probably Heroku)
2. add more functionalities as designed by the UX/UI designer
3. clean up React code
4. resume React native
